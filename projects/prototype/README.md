# Don't get possessed!

This is a prototype I created to explore different Phaser 3 elemements that I wanted to learn more about such as sprites, animation, render textures, and masks. I drew all of the sprites and visuals myself in Piskel. I have been wanting to use a flashlight effect since last semester so it was really fun to figure out using Phaser. I also enjoyed creating my own animations and I found it much easier to do this using phaser compared to how I had apprached it in the past. 

In this prototype a ghost appears in the room when the lights are off an moves towards the avatar. The user controls the avatar with the arrow keys and the animation will play as the avatar moves. The user can press the button to make the lights go back on which keeps them away from the ghost. 

flashlight effect was created inspired by this tutorial by Tommy Leung: https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/phaser3-fog-of-war-field-of-view-roguelike/
