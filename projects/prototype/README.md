# Escape the story!
Overview: 

Once upon a time, there was a girl…who was tired of cleaning…and didn’t want to go to the ball…or marry the stinky prince. My game takes place in a fairy tale (very similar to Cinderella), where the lead character wants to escape her story. She becomes self-aware after discovering a note in the first chapter (my prototype) where she is cleaning the attic. She then goes on a quest to break out of the story (which will consist of many different scenes and mini-games). In the final scene of the game, when the protagonist goes to a final location guarded by a dragon. The only way to defeat the dragon is not by fighting it, but by laughing. My goal for this game is to reflect the protagonist’s progress in breaking out of her story by adding glitches that worsen as the player gets closer to beating the game. 

All assets were drawn by me.

Further improvements: 
I would like to change my action menu to be over the character's head, or be placed in a way that is easier to understand. With the way the text is positioned in this prototype I do not think it is very clear. I would also like to have the text change color when the user hovers their mouse over the text before pressing on it so that it seems more clickable.
