# Opposite Day
by LÃ©a Fournier, created February 2024

"Why did the chicken cross the road?"

"To get to the other side."

In this game the user gives directions to the chicken to help it get to the other side of the road by avoiding traffic and other various dangerous obstacles. But plot twist, it's opposite day!! 

This is a prototype to explore using the p5.speech library using speech recognition. 

I wanted to make the game more challenging and silly by working with opposites. When the user says "up" the chicken goes down, when the user says "down" the chicken goes up, when the user says "right" the chicken goes left, and when the user says "left" the chicken goes right. I also tried to implement this into the Instruction State of my game by displaying the text "click to begin", when the user actually has to not touch the mouse in order to start the game. If the user does press their mouse in the Instruction State it will go back to the Title State.
