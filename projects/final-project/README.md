# Escape the story!
Overview: 

Once upon a time, there was a girl…who was tired of cleaning…and didn’t want to go to the ball…or marry the stinky prince. My game takes place in a fairy tale (very similar to Cinderella), where the lead character wants to escape her story. She becomes self-aware after discovering a note in the first chapter where she is cleaning the attic. She then goes on a quest to break out of the story (different scenes and mini-games). In the final scene of the game, where the protagonist must fight a dragon, the only way to defeat the dragon is not by fighting it, but by laughing. I had a lot of fun playing with narration and audio and seeing how that can contrast with what happens on screen. I wanted to show that the lead character has free will and is not following the narrator and story. 

All assets were drawn by me. All audio was recorded by me, voiced by my friend Schuyler Garfield.
